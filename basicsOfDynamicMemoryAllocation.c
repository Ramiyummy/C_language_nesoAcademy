/*
# Static Memory Allocation: memory allocated during compile time is called static memory. The memory allocated
is fixed and cannot be incrased or decreased during run time.
# Dynamic Memory Allocatin: the process of allocating memory at the time of execution is called dynamic
memory allocation.
#Heap: is a the segment of memory where dynamic memory allocation takes place.
-Unlike stack where memory is allocated or deallocated in a defined order, heap is an area of memory where memory
is allocated or opposite without any order or randomly.
# Pointer play an important role in Dynamic Memory Allocation.
-Allocated memory can only be accessed through pointers.
