/*
-Prototype: char* strcpy(char * dest, const char* src).
-const char* source: because the source isn't modified. That is why it is constant, we're just copying it to dest.
-strcpy: is used to copy a string pointed by source(including '\0') to the dest(char array).
-strcpy: returns the pointer to the 1st char of the str which is copied in the dest.Thus, the pointer to 1st char in src.
