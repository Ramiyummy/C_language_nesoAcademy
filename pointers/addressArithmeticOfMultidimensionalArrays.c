title: Address Arithmetic of Multidimensional arrays.
in 2D array: *a points to the element of the first 1D array. Thus, the addres of the first element of the 1st 1D array.
thus: *a = *(a+0) = a[0] = &a[0][0]
in order to get the value, we do: **a, which is 1 in this array a[2][2]={1,2,3,4};
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in 3D array: a[2][2][2], a is the pointer to the first 2D array,
